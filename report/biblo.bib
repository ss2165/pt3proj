abstract = {The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multihadronic final state. It contains a library of hard processes and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs. While previous versions were written in Fortran, Pythia 8 represents a complete rewrite in C++. The current release is the first main one after this transition, and does not yet in every respect replace the old code. It does contain some new physics aspects, on the other hand, that should make it an attractive option especially for LHC physics studies. 

PROGRAM SUMMARY
Program title: Pythia 8.1 Catalogue identifier: ACTU{\_}v3{\_}0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ACTU{\_}v3{\_}0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GPL version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 176 981 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 2 411 876 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++ Computer: Commodity PCs Operating system: Linux; should also work on other systems RAM: 8 megabytes Classification: 11.2 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes, partly Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models, transition from Fortran to C++. Summary of revisions: New user interface, transverse-momentum-ordered showers, interleaving with multiple interactions, and much more. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied. References: [1] T. Sj{\"{o}}strand, P. Ed{\'{e}}n, C. Friberg, L. L{\"{o}}nnblad, G. Miu, S. Mrenna, E. Norrbin, Comput. Phys.

@article{Bengio2014,
abstract = {We introduce a novel training principle for prob-abilistic models that is an alternative to max-imum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. The transition distribution of the Markov chain is conditional on the previ-ous state, generally involving a small move, so this conditional distribution has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it is easier to approximate its partition function, more like learning to perform supervised func-tion approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. We provide theorems that generalize recent work on the probabilistic inter-pretation of denoising autoencoders and obtain along the way an interesting justification for de-pendency networks and generalized pseudolike-lihood, along with a definition of an appropri-ate joint distribution and sampling mechanism even when the conditionals are not consistent. GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. We validate these theoretical results with experiments on two image datasets using an ar-chitecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Ma-chine Gibbs sampler but allows training to pro-ceed with simple backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining. P(X) X C X|X X P(X X) P(X) X P(H|X) H P(X|H) Figure 1. Top: A denoising auto-encoder defines an estimated Markov chain where the transition operator first samples a cor-rupte X from C X|X) and then samples a reconstruction from P $\theta$ (X X), which is trained to estimate the ground truth P (X X). Note how for any give{\~{n}} X, P (X X) is a much simpler (roughly unimodal) distribution than the ground truth P (X) and its parti-tion function is thus easier to approximate. Bottom: More gen-erally, a GSN allows the use of arbitrary latent variables H in addition to X, with the Markov chain state (and mixing) involv-ing both X and H. Here H is the angle about the origin. The GSN inherits the benefit of a simpler conditional and adds latent variables, which allow far more powerful deep representations in which mixing is easier (Bengio et al., 2013b).},

@article{delphes,
abstract = {The version 3.0 of the Delphes fast-simulation is presented. The goal of Delphes is to allow the simulation of a multipurpose detector for phenomenological studies. The simulation includes a track propagation system embedded in a magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and a muon identification system. Physics objects that can be used for data analysis are then reconstructed from the simulated detector response. These include tracks and calorimeter deposits and high level objects such as isolated electrons, jets, taus, and missing energy. The new modular approach allows for greater flexibility in the design of the simulation and reconstruction sequence. New features such as the particle-flow reconstruction approach, crucial in the first years of the LHC, and pile-up simulation and mitigation, which is needed for the simulation of the LHC detectors in the near future, have also been implemented. The Delphes framework is not meant to be used for advanced detector studies, for which more accurate tools are needed. Although some aspects of Delphes are hadron collider specific, it is flexible enough to be adapted to the needs of electron-positron collider experiments.},

@article{Srivastava2014,
abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different " thinned " networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversar- ial process; in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution; and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather thanG. The train- ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D; a unique solution exists; with G recovering the training data distribution andD equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G andD are defined by multilayer perceptrons; the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. 1},

abstract = {Many inference problems involve data generation processes that are not uniquely specified or are uncertain in some way. In a scientific context, the presence of several plausible data generation processes is often associated to the presence of systematic uncertainties. Robust inference is possible if it is based on a pivot -- a quantity whose distribution is invariant to the unknown value of the (categorical or continuous) nuisance parameters that parametrizes this family of generation processes. In this work, we introduce a flexible training procedure based on adversarial networks for enforcing the pivotal property on a predictive model. We derive theoretical results showing that the proposed algorithm tends towards a minimax solution corresponding to a predictive model that is both optimal and independent of the nuisance parameters (if that models exists) or for which one can tune the trade-off between power and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with a toy example and an example from particle physics.},

abstract = {The high luminosity of the LHC results in a significant background to interesting physics events known as pile-up. ATLAS has adopted two independent methods for modeling pile-up and its effect on analyses. The first is a bottom-up approach, using a detailed simulation of the detector to recreate each component of the pile-up background. The second uses specially recorded data events to emulate it. This article reports on the experience using both of these methods, inclusing performance considerations, for simulating pile-up in ATLAS.},

@article{Alwall2014,
abstract = {We discuss the theoretical bases that underpin the automation of the computations of tree-level and next-to-leading order cross sections, of their matching to parton shower simulations, and of the merging of matched samples that differ by light-parton multiplicities. We present a computer program, MadGraph5{\_}aMC@NLO, capable of handling all these computations -- parton-level fixed order, shower-matched, merged -- in a unified framework whose defining features are flexibility, high level of parallelisation, and human intervention limited to input physics quantities. We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the LHC and to a 1-TeV {\$}e{\^{}}+e{\^{}}-{\$} collider. While next-to-leading order results are restricted to QCD corrections to SM processes in the first public version, we show that from the user viewpoint no changes have to be expected in the case of corrections due to any given renormalisable Lagrangian, and that the implementation of these are well under way.},

@article{Beaudette2014,
abstract = {A particle flow event-reconstruction algorithm has been successfully deployed in the CMS experiment and is nowadays used by most of the analyses. It aims at identifying and reconstructing individually each particle arising from the LHC proton-proton collision, by combining the information from all the subdetectors. The resulting particle-flow event reconstruction leads to an improved performance for the reconstruction of jets and MET, and for the identification of electrons, muons, and taus. The algorithm and its performance will be described. The commissioning phase, during which it was demonstrated that the algorithm was performing as expected from the simulation up to a high level of precision, will be presented. Finally, a selection of recent improvements in the CMS analyses obtained thanks to the particle-flow algorithm will be discussed.},

@article{Radford2015,
abstract = {In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},
