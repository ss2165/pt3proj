@book{data,
	abstract = {2nd ed. / D.S. Sivia with J. Skilling. Focusing on Bayesian methods and maximum entropy, this book shows how a few fundamental rules can be used to tackle a variety of problems in data analysis. Topics covered include reliability analysis, multivariate optimisation, least-squares and maximum likelihood, and more. PART I: THE ESSENTIALS; 1. The basics; 2. Parameter estimation I; 3. Parameter estimation II; 4. Model selection; 5. Assigning probabilities; PART II: ADVANCED TOPICS; 6. Non-parametric estimation; 7. Experimental design; 8. Least-squares extensions; 9. Nested sampling; 10. Quantification; A. Gaussian integrals; B. Cox's derivation of probability; Bibliography; Index; A; B; C; D; E; F; G; H; I; J; K; L; M; N; O; P; Q; R; S; T; U; V; W; X.},
